# WebGIS-with-Opensauce
Hi there,

Welcome to my blog series on WebGIS using open source tools and technologies with the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial Applications(FOSS4G) Stack. This 10 somewhat long-section series aims to introduce you to the beauty of WebGIS and some of the cool things you can pull off with it especially with absolutely free tech stacks. It'll run the gamut from basic to advanced operations using several tools, technologies, and frameworks. A WebGIS project would be implemented towards the end of the series to apply the knowledge gained. All resources used in this series could be found in this GitHub repository. You would also find a playlist for this series on my Youtube channel sometime in the future, kindly subscribe and turn on post notification to be informed when it's released. I do hope you have a lovely read and find this series helpful.
